Some Bible Code History
 
The Bible code is the idea that there are hidden messages and prophecies encoded in the text of the Bible. The most common method of finding these codes is by using a technique called equidistant letter sequence (ELS), which involves skipping a fixed number of letters between each letter of a word or phrase. For example, the word "Torah" can be found in the first five books of the Hebrew Bible by skipping 49 letters between each letter.
 
The first person to discover ELS in the Bible was Rabbi Michael Weissmandl, a Jewish scholar who lived in Czechoslovakia in the 1930s and 1940s. He found several examples of ELS in the Torah, such as the names of famous rabbis and their dates of birth and death. However, he did not publish his findings or claim any prophetic significance for them.
 
The modern interest in the Bible code was sparked by a paper published in 1994 by three Israeli mathematicians, Eliyahu Rips, Doron Witztum and Yoav Rosenberg. They claimed that they had found statistically significant ELS in the Book of Genesis that related to modern events and personalities, such as the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister of Israel. Their paper was published in a prestigious journal called Statistical Science, which gave it credibility and attention.
 
Their paper also inspired Michael Drosnin, an American journalist and author, who wrote a best-selling book called The Bible Code in 1997. Drosnin claimed that he had found many more ELS in the Bible that predicted future events, such as World War III, a comet impact and the end of the world. He also claimed that he had warned Rabin about his assassination before it happened, based on an ELS he had found in the Torah.
 
However, Drosnin's claims were met with skepticism and criticism by many scholars and scientists, who argued that his methods were flawed and his interpretations were arbitrary. They pointed out that ELS can be found in any text, not just the Bible, and that they do not prove anything beyond coincidence or human imagination. They also showed that Drosnin's predictions were often vague, inaccurate or failed to materialize.
 
Despite the controversy and criticism, the Bible code remains a popular topic for many people who are fascinated by the possibility of finding hidden messages and secrets in the ancient text. With Codefinder Millennium Edition Full Version 11, you can join them and explore the Bible code for yourself.
