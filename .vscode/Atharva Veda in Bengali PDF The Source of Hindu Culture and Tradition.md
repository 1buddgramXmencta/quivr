The Atharva Veda is one of the four Vedas, the sacred scriptures of Hinduism. It is also known as the Veda of magic and medicine, as it contains many hymns and mantras for various purposes, such as healing, protection, prosperity, and success. The Atharva Veda is different from the other three Vedas (Rig, Sama, and Yajur) in that it is more concerned with the practical aspects of life than the ritualistic ones.
  
The Atharva Veda was composed by various sages over a long period of time, probably between 1500 and 1000 BCE. It consists of 20 books (kandas) with a total of 730 hymns (suktas) and about 6000 verses. The Atharva Veda covers a wide range of topics, such as cosmology, ethics, social issues, warfare, marriage, family, agriculture, trade, magic, witchcraft, sorcery, charms, spells, curses, diseases, remedies, herbs, plants, animals, spirits, ghosts, demons, gods, goddesses, and ancestors.
