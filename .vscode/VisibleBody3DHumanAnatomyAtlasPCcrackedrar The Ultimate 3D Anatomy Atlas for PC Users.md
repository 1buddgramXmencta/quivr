However, MPC Software is not cheap. It costs $199.99 on Akai's website[^1^], and you need to register and activate it online. If you want to use MPC Software without paying or registering, you might be tempted to look for a crack version online.
 
A crack is a modified version of a software that bypasses its copy protection or activation system. Some websites claim to offer free downloads of cracked software for various applications, including MPC Software[^3^]. But are they safe and legal?
