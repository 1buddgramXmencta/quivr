If you are playing Skyrim Special Edition and you have trouble with the voice dialog, such as not hearing any voices, hearing voices in a different language, or having events not trigger due to missing dialog files, you may need to fix the Skyrim Voicesbsa English issue. This issue occurs when the game does not have the correct voice file for the English language, which is named Skyrim - Voices\_en0.bsa.

There are different ways to fix this issue, depending on your situation. Here are some possible solutions:
 
## Solution 1: Download English Dialog Fix Mod
 
If you are using Nexus Mod Manager, you can download and install a mod called **English Dialog Fix** [^1^] that will add the missing voice file to your game data folder. This mod is compatible with any other audio mods and does not require a plugin. To install this mod, follow these steps:

2. Open Nexus Mod Manager and click on the Add Mod from File button.
3. Select the downloaded file and install it.
4. Activate the mod and run the game.

## Solution 2: Copy and Rename Skyrim - Voices\_en0.bsa File
 
If you do not want to use a mod or if you are playing Skyrim VR, you can manually copy and rename the Skyrim - Voices\_en0.bsa file from another source. You can either get this file from another installation of Skyrim Special Edition that has the English language pack, or from a friend who has it. To fix the issue using this method, follow these steps:

1. Find the Skyrim - Voices\_en0.bsa file from another source and copy it to a safe location.
2. Open Steam and go to your library.
3. Right-click on Skyrim Special Edition and select Properties.
4. Go to Language tab and select your preferred language (not English).
5. Wait for Steam to download the language pack.
6. Navigate to your game data folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data).
7. Find the voice file that matches your selected language (for example, Skyrim - Voices\_it0.bsa for Italian) and rename it to something else (for example, Skyrim - Voices\_it0.bsa.old).
8. Copy the Skyrim - Voices\_en0.bsa file from the safe location and paste it into your game data folder.
9. Rename it to match your selected language (for example, Skyrim - Voices\_it0.bsa for Italian).
10. Run the game and enjoy the English voices.

## Solution 3: Download SSE High Quality Voices Mod
 
If you want to improve the sound quality of the game voices, you can download and install a mod called **SSE High Quality Voices** [^2^] that will replace the original voice files with higher quality ones. This mod uses a higher bitrate (192kbp/s) than the vanilla voices (48kbp/s), which results in clearer and less muddy sound. This mod is also packed in BSA archives for easier installation, faster loading and better compatibility. It is available for both English and French languages. To install this mod, follow these steps:

1. Go to [SSE High Quality Voices mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17035?tab=description) and download both parts of your preferred language manually.
2. Open Nexus Mod Manager and click on the Add Mod from File button.
3. Select both downloaded files and install them.
4. Activate both mods and run the game.
